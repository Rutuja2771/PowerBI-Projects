Welcome to my Power BI dashboard project! This repository contains the files and information related to my interactive dashboard.

   - Highlights key metrics and KPIs for quick assessment.
   - Includes an average and median matrix to track the overall waiting list statistics.

2. **Detailed Page:**
   - Offers a granular analysis of the patients' waiting list.
   - Allows users to explore detailed information, trends, and historical data.
